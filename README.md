# manuscript-line-counter
This is the script to count manuscript lines with rotation correction.

## How to Use it?
1. Install the required libraries (scipy, scikit-learn, numpy, cv2).
2. Run the code using the name of the image as an argument.
```Shell
python3 find_and_count_lines.py img.jpg
```
3. The number of lines is printed on the terminal and the lines are drawn onto the output image (`s_img.jpg`).
